# 11ty-trafikskadetjanst
Alternative implementation of the site for Trafikskadetj√§nst using 11ty. The reason to do it is to learn 11ty better and also how to work efficiently with gitub repositories inside Visuall Studio Code. The live version of the web site is still the one developed in Dreamweaver.
